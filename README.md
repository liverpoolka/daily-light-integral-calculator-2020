# Agritecture-s-Daily-Light-Integral-Calculator-2020
What is DLI ? DLI stands for Daily Light Integral. It is the measurement of the total amount of light that falls in a certain location. Knowing the DLI is important in determining if there is sufficient natural light for your crops or if supplemental light is required for your greenhouse operation.

How it works ? First, choose the DLI reading you want from the drop-down menu.  Then fill in the address, zip code or city name where your farm/ greenhouse is located and hit ENTER.  Review the map to make sure the location is correct. Then, use the table below which displays the daily DLI readings by month.

The DLI values are needed to estimate which crops will grow better given the particular location (latitude) and month.
The app was made for the Agritecture Consulting LLC.

The updated DLI Calculator calcuales daily light integral not on daily basis, but rather outputs monthly average dli-s based on the location. The updated calculator is more user-friendly: only one input variable is collected from the user (location) to calculate the dli, opposed to 4 values (transmittance, location, day and month) in the previous version of the DLI Calculator.

Moreover, to facilitate address search, map was integrated with the use of Google Map API - the marker shows the location entered by the user
